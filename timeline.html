              <p>Japan’s invasion of Manchuria increased tensions before World War II, and eventually caused the attack on Pearl Harbor, which got the United States involved in the war. This ultimately led to the Allies winning the war. It also paved the way for Japanese involvement in the war.</p>

              <p>Germany was severely unstable, and Hitler earned public favor by promising stability for Germany. If not for Hitler’s rise to power there may not have been a Second World War to begin with, as it was under his rule that Germany invaded Poland.

              <p>Germany invading Poland marked the beginning of World War II, as both Great Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany in response. To justify the action, the SS colluded with the German military to stage a phony attack on a German radio station, and accused the Poles of this attack.</p>

              <p>The battle of River Plate was the first major naval battle of the Second World War, so the victory resulted in a major boost of morale for the UK. This came at great cost though as 72 allied soldiers and 36 German soldiers were lost.</p>

              <p>Churchill had acquired a reputation for military leadership ability which is why he was chosen to replace Chamberlain as prime minister. Churchill was vital to the war because he succeeded in rallying the British people and led the UK from near defeat all the way to victory.</p>

              <p>The miracle of Dunkirk was a critical turning point in World War II, and it was only possible because Hitler exercised restraint by halting his panzer tanks for a couple of days shortly before the evacuation began. Hitler was hoping that the British would more readily negotiate if he gave them clemency, but instead the evacuation inspired national pride and gave the British momentum.</p>

              <p>The fall of Paris was a severe blow to the Allied powers, as it meant the loss of France and one of the main forces fighting against Germany was inevitable. The decision to surrender Paris was made because France believed that resistance was not worth the destruction of such a beautiful and historic city, as it was a major symbol of French pride.</p>

              <p>The Battle of Britain was a crucial victory for the Allies, as Britain was able to hold the war in Western Europe and prevent Germany from invading Britain on the land or sea. Hitler hoped to weaken Britain’s morale by devastating it with aerial bombing, but Britain’s radar relays and technologically superior aircrafts prevented the German planes from having the destructive effect desired.</p>

              <p>The Blitz was a devastating period of 57 straight nights during which German bombers raided the city of London almost every night and sometimes during the day.

              <p>Operation Compass was an offensive in North Africa in which the Allied Western Desert Force pushed the Italian forces out of Egypt and Eastern Libya.

              <p>Operation Barbarossa, a German invasion of the USSR, was delayed by five weeks due to the German invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece. Nevertheless, Hitler and the heads of the OKH (the German Army High Command), believed that they would be able to defeat the Red Army before the end of October, not realizing the many hindrances that the USSR could put in place, or that there would be an early winter that year in which many German troops would freeze.</p>

              <p>The Attack on Pearl Harbor involved three waves of heavy bombing from Japanese planes, each wave targeting a different area of the naval base. Though Japan was hoping to weaken the US navy and negotiate a quick peace, the US quickly declared war on Japan and joined the Allies. While the US was already providing support via resources, it now sent troops to fight as well.</p>
