      <h2>Domestic Effort to Win WWII</h2>
      <p>There were several aspects of the domestic effort to help win World War Two by those not fighting the war overseas. Evacuation plans had to be made to remove women and children from large cities because large cities were more likely to be bombed. Since many working men were needed in the navy and army, women were recruited for jobs done previously by men, such as working in the factories and constructing weapons and ammunition. Additionally, since a lot of food came from abroad, there were shortages of many essential items, leading to strict rationing. People were heavily encouraged to grow food for themselves on any available land that they had access to. People were also encouraged to refrain from talking about the war in case spies were listening.</p>

      <h2>The Role of Women</h2>
      <p>Rosie the Riveter, a cultural icon, was a symbol for women’s employment during the war. Women worked as welders, machinists, riveters, truck drivers, house cleaners, pilots, fundraiser organizers, and code breakers. Women also treated patients, grew crops, and took care of children. Additionally, many women joined the armed forces.</p>

      <h2>Japanese American Internment</h2>
      <p>On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order No. 9066, which allowed the Army to designate areas from which “any or all persons may be excluded,” even though not a single person of Japanese ancestry was convicted of espionage or sabotage against the United States. These people were taken from their homes and placed in concentration camps for the duration of the war entirely because of prejudice and wartime hysteria. The West Coast has a long history of anti-asian prejudice, originally only directed at Chinese Americans. Due to increased Chinese immigration, many white people began to consider them to be competitors. When Japanese immigration started to rise, these pre-existing anti-Asian prejudices transferred over to Japanese Americans.</p>

      <h2>The Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles</h2>
      <p>Zoot suits were a type of fashion popular during the WWII era. They were initially created in the urban black scene, but spread to Mexican Americans, Italian Americans, and Filipino Americans. The Zoot Suit Riots began when sailors got into an argument with zoot suit wearers and a conflict occurred between them. The next day, a large group of sailors headed to the center of Mexican American settlement in Los Angeles and saw a group of people wearing zoot suits. They attacked them, stripped them of their zoot suits, and burned the clothing. Attacks like these spread through Los Angeles, until they began to subside when Navy leaders banned military personnel from the city. The riots were blamed on the suits being unpatriotic, as they used lots of fabric, but also originated from racist beliefs. No sailors or other attackers were arrested for the riots, but rather the Mexican American victims were blamed.</p>

      <p><strong>Origin:</strong> This source was created by Charles Henry Alston in 1943, but it comes from the Records of the Office of War Information, and has the National Archives Identifier 535598. Charles Henry Alston was an African American artist who produced over one hundred government propagandistic illustrations supporting the national position on the war. The cartoons were targeted to a black audience and designed exclusively for publication in black newspapers to discuss the controversial issues in the black community.<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> The source is meant to promote the war and convince young Americans to form a victory corps in their schools or join one. It is propaganda that is supposed to justify the war and encourage students to become involved in the war effort. It does this in part by suggesting to the young people of the time that they have large shoes to fill, which pressured them into doing something that they thought would fill those shoes.<br><strong>Content:</strong> The source displays two young people standing in large shoes with the words "VICTORY CORPS" on their shirts and the captions "Form One In Your High School~NOW!" and "BE READY TO JUMP INTO THEIR SHOES!!" There is a group of soldiers on the left, what seems to be a factory on the right, and a large V behind the students. It seems to encourage highschool students to join the war effort by either becoming soldiers or by joining the workforce.<br><strong>Value:</strong> This source tells us a lot about the home front of the war and the way that many young people were pressured to join the war effort, either as soldiers or workers. It also shows how the war permeated every aspect of life, even education, and how propaganda targeted people starting at a young age. It also includes some details such as how young people dressed at the time, though those are largely irrelevant to the point the poster is trying to make.<br><strong>Limitations:</strong> The poster only tells the story from a pro-war point of view, without addressing the views of people who were against the war, or whether or not there was any controversy about the war at all. It also underrepresents the horror of the war, seeming to glorify it rather than expose its cruelties.<br>&emsp;- Teague</p>

      <p><strong>Origin: </strong>This source is a poster showing how to shop using a ration book (War Ration Book Two), and it has the National Archives ID 514549. It was created by the Bureau of Special Services, a government branch created as part of the Office of War Information in March 1943. <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/535821">This image</a> shows children making a play store that includes this poster.<br><br><strong>Purpose: </strong>This source was meant to show Americans with ration books how to use their ration books to purchase food. It has six steps on how to purchase rations. It also explains why rations existed - the troops get the first access to food. In all, the main purpose of this source is informing the public.<br><br><strong>Content: </strong>This poster has a list of the many things that you can use ration stamps for (canned, bottled, frozen fruits…) located at the top, beneath the title. With colorful illustrations, it explains and illustrates what the ration book is and how to properly use it. It also has a small portion at the bottom used as propaganda for justifying the stamps, saying that food is going to fighting men first and that “your ration gives you your fair share of the foods that are left."<br><br><strong>Value: </strong>This source is quite valuable for understanding how the US rationing system worked. It shows the kinds of things that you can buy with your ration stamps, how the ration stamps were used, what wasn’t rationed, and why rationing occurred.<br><br><strong>Limitations: </strong>This source is limited to how to use the ration books. It does not say how many stamps people would get, or give a complete list of things you could buy with a ration book. It also is pro-government and does not say that the ration books could be ineffective, it paints it in a good light.<br><br>&emsp;- Isaac</p>
