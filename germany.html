    <h1 style="text-align: center";>The Rise of Hitler, Antisemitism, and Nazism in Germany</h1>
    <div class="txt-block">
      <h2>Hitler's Rise to Power</h2>
      <p>After WWI, the allied powers charged the Weimar Republic with reparations that it was unable to fulfill, so it began to print money, causing hyperinflation. The cost of bread rose from 3 Reichsmarks in 1922 to 80 billion Reichsmarks in 1923. There was a recessionist movement which radicalized sections of the labor force. The national right in Bavaria, as a breach of the Weimar constitution, declared a state of emergency. No action was taken against Bavaria, though its leader was preparing a military coup. The German Workers’ party became the National Socialist German Workers’ Party in 1920, and Hitler named himself chairman of the party in 1921. After attempting his own coup, Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison. He served less than eight months, during which he wrote Mein Kampf. After this there was a period of five years called the “golden twenties” from 1924-1929. It featured an unstable political system, a softening of class fronts, and the “Young Plan” a plan to pay 2 billion Reichsmarks per year over 59 years in order to pay off reparations. This era soon ended with the Great Depression in 1930, which shook the German economy. A new finance expert then halted the economy and lowered wages and benefits, losing favor from the president, who replaced him with Adolf Hitler. In the election of July 1932, the Nazi Party won 37.3% of the vote. Since there was still no majority, a new election was scheduled. Kurt von Schleicher, a behind the scenes army general, maneuvered Papen out of the chancellor’s office in favor of himself. Amid rising fears about Schleicher deposing Hindenburg, Papen convinced him to appoint Hitler as chancellor.</p>

      <h2>Anti-Semitism</h2>
      <p>Antisemitism is thought to have originated in Egypt and been spread by the Greeks. An ancient Jewish philosopher from Alexandria described an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE which may have been caused by the Jews being misportrayed as misanthropes. Other arguments about the origin of antisemitism include that the cause was their separateness in the Greek cities, or that early hatred toward Jews weren’t anti semitic because many Greeks showed animosity toward anyone they deemed to be barbarous. In either case, many examples of anti-jewish sentiments can be found throughout Greece and ancient Rome, though Roman-Jewish relations had a period of increased tolerance from about 160 CE to the time that Christianity became the state religion. The late 6th century CE involved the Catholic Visigothic kingdom in Hispania issuing anti-Jewish laws which forbade Jews from marrying Christians or practicing many of their religious beliefs, imposing punishments ranging between forced conversion, slavery, exile, and death. There was then a golden age from the 9th century to at least the 11th century during which medieval Islamic countries offered Jews legal protection, though several Muslim pogroms against Jews were instated afterward. There were several Jewish massacres during the Crusades, followed by expulsions. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland. Throughout Renaissance Europe, the Franciscans and Dominicans combed Europe and promoted antisemitism through their fiery appeals. The Black Death was also blamed on Jews, and, though Pope Clement VI tried to protect them, many Jewish communities were destroyed. Martin Luther once wrote “...we are at fault in not slaying them…” when referring to the Jews. Antisemitism was brought to the United States as early as the 17th century, and New Amsterdam even implemented plans to keep Jews out of the city. Even Voltaire harbored a hatred of Jews. Catholic royalist Louis de Bonald called for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the French Revolution, declaring Jews to be a “state within a state,”  and that they should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to identify and discriminate against them. Many historians claim the 19th century was when the position of Jews in Muslim countries worsened. In 1850 Richard Wagner, “the inventor of modern antisemitism”, accused Jews of being harmful to German culture, corrupting morals and controlling the money economy. Many scholars view Karl Marx’s essay “On The Jewish Question” as antisemitic, though the subject is up for debate. From 1900 and 1924, many Jews migrated to America to escape pogroms. Hitler then rose to power with a vision of a “racially pure” Germany. The Nazis tried to concentrate Jews in camps or deport them, though this proved hard. Soon, anti-Jewish regulations were issued, including forced labor, the wearing of white armbands, and the seizure of most Jewish properties. The first ghettos were established in 1939, and often factories were operated from the labor of the ghetto inhabitants. Soon after began a systematic shooting of Jews, where the victims would undress and by shot into previously dug pits. Many were not killed by the gunfire but buried alive instead. Many groups besides jews were targeted as well, such as Slavs, non-Europeans, people with disabilities, homosexual men, and Romani.</p>

      <h2>Kristallnacht and Lebensraum</h2>
      <p>Krisallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, was a pogrom against Jews carried out by Nazis and the Sturmabteilung and Schutzstaffel, along with participation from the Hitler Youth and civilians that took place throughout Germany on November 9-10 in 1938. The pretext was the assassination of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by a Polish Jew. Jewish homes, hospitals, and schools were ransacked when rioters demolished buildings with sledgehammers, destroying 267 synagogues. Over 7,000- businesses were damaged or destroyed and 30,000 Jewish men were incarcerated. Lebensraum, which means living space, is a German concept of expansionism which became a geopolitical goal of Germany in World War I. It was also the leading motivator for Nazi Germany to initiate World War II, as the Nazi party supported the ultimate goal to establish a Greater German Reich. The Nazi party aimed to conquer Central and Eastern Europe and replace most of the populations there with Germans in the name of Lebensraum.</p>
