      <h2>What is fascism?</h2>
      <p>Fascism is generally described as a far right political movement involving militarism, nationalism, and antiliberalism. Fascism is most commonly associated with Nazi Germany and Benito Mussolini’s Italy, though there have been other fascist nations throughout history. Fascism rejects the idea that violence is inherently pointless, but instead views war as a method of national rejuvenation.</p>

      <h2>Mussolini’s Background</h2>
      <p>Mussolini was born on July 19th in 1883 to Alessandro Mussolini, a blacksmith and socialist, and Rosa, a Catholic schoolteacher. Mussolini’s early political views were in line with those of his father, who combined the views of anarchist figures like Carlo Cafiero with the authoritarianism of Garibaldi and the nationalism of Mazzini. Mussolini was sent to a boarding school where he fought with his teachers and fellow students because of his violent behavior. In July of 1902, Mussolini emigrated to Switzerland to avoid compulsory military service, and during his time, he studied the ideas of Friedrich Nieztsche, Vilfredo Pareto, and Georges Sorel. Sorel impressed Mussolini with his use of neoMachiavellian appeals to emotion and his emphasis on overthrowing liberal democracy and capitalism through violence. Mussolini became an active part in the Italian socialist movement in Switzerland, getting arrested several times before returning to Italy to take advantage of an amnesty for desertion from the military. Part of this involved serving in the army, so he joined the corps of Bersaglieri in Forlì. He left Italy again in 1909 to take a job in Trento, which used to be part of Austria-Hungary. While there he read philosophy, including works by Sorel, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Gustave Hervé, Errico Malatesta, Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. He also wrote several essays in this time as well as an anticlerical serial book published in the Trento newspaper Il Popolo. In September of 1911, he participated in a riot to protest the Italian war in Libya, and in 1912 he joined the Italian Socialist Party. </p>

      <h2>Mussolini’s Transition from Communism to Fascism</h2>
      <p>In 1913, Mussolini considered himself “an authoritarian communist”, sometimes using the pen name “Vero Eretico” or sincere heretic. He rejected egalitarianism, feeling that socialism had faltered, and believed that Nietzsche’s anti-Christian ideas would strengthen socialism. During WWI, the socialist party decided to oppose the war, and Mussolini agreed, until he decided to declare support for the war, seeing it as an opportunity for socialists to overthrow the Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies which had repressed socialism. He was expelled from the party for his support of intervention. After his expulsion, Mussolini made a radical shift, denouncing orthodox socialism for failing to accept that national identity was more significant than class distinction. These political principles formed Mussolini’s new political movement, the Fasci d’Azione Rivoluzionaria, the members of which called themselves fascists. At first the Fascist party was small and ineffective, but after serving in WWI, Mussolini re-formed the Milan fascio as the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento, consisting of 200 members. A variety of sources contributed to the ideological basis for fascism, and Plato’s The Republic expounded several of these ideas, such as rule by an elite opposition to democracy, promotion of militarism, and utilising education to promote the development of future soldiers and rulers. Though racism was not as prominent in Fascism as in Nazism, there was also a racist undercurrent, such as when Mussolini promoted a “natural law” that stronger people should dominate “inferior” people like the Slavic people of Yugoslavia.</p>

      <h2>The Links Between Fascism and the Rise of Nazism</h2>
      <p>Nazism and Fascism are considered to be similar, and nazism is often considered a type of fascism. The two, however, have differences, as the primary focus of fascism is the state, but the primary focus of nazism is racism. Hitler contributed the rise of Nazism to the success of fascism in Italy. In a private conversation, he said that "the brown shirt would probably not have existed without the black shirt," the “brown shirt” referring to the Nazi militia and the “black shirt” referring to the fascist militia. In all, many of Hitler’s values were similar to those of fascism, and his rise to power was linked strongly to the rise of Fascism.</p>

      <h2>Analysis: Mussolini's Significance to WWII</h2>
      <p>As the dictator of Italy and the ally of Hitler, Mussolini played a significant role in WWII. Before Italy’s involvement in the war, both the Allies and Germany recognized that Italy was an important world power to consider when fighting the war and therefore both wished to gain Mussolini’s support. When Mussolini and Italy did join the war, it was on the German side due to the victory of Germany seeming likely. Mussolini saw this war against Britain and France as a war between fascism and the "plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the west"—describing the war as "the struggle of the fertile and young people against the sterile people moving to the sunset; it is the struggle between two centuries and two ideas." Throughout the war, Italy fought in many places, most notably North Africa, the Balkans, eastern Europe, and the Mediterranean. However, as Italian resources ran out and the Allies had many victories, Mussolini faced many defeats and loss of the war seemed inevitable. He was then overthrown and imprisoned by his fascist colleagues. Later, he was freed by Germany, but when Italy was being invaded he fled and then was captured and shot by Italian partisans. In all, Mussolini was an important factor in WWII. He participated in many parts of the war and was part of the decline of the Axis powers. However, his decision to join the war in the first place was not a good one as it led to disaster for Mussolini and Italy. He worked closely with Hitler initially, but eventually became only a puppet leader under him.</p>
