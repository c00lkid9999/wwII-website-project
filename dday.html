      <h2>Why was D-Day so significant?</h2>
      <p>D-Day, officially called operation overlord, was an amphibious invasion of several beaches in Normandy, France named Utah beach, Omaha beach, Gold Beach, Juno Beach, and Sword Beach. It was the largest amphibious assault in history, beginning on the morning of June 6th with an aerial and naval bombardment of the beaches as well as a landing of 24,000 American, British, and Canadian airborne troops. Operation Overlord secured a position on the coast of France from where the Allies could begin their march eastward toward Berlin to defeat Germany. The troops who fought in the first landing experienced heavy gunfire and obstacles like wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, all of which made the beach-clearing work incredibly dangerous and exceedingly difficult. The invasion was massively successful and dealt a huge blow to German morale, while increasing partisan activity against Germany and majorly increasing Allied Morale. D-Day represents the point in the war where the balance of power in Europe tipped to favor the Allies as they began the fight to push the Germans back to Berlin.</p>

      <h2>Why was D-Day the beginning of the end of WWII?</h2>
      <p>D-Day proved to be a major turning point in World War Two for several reasons. The D-Day invasion worked to prevent Hitler and the Nazi party from transferring troops from France to the Eastern Front to fight against the growing Soviet threat. This was compounded by the fact that the Allies were successful in keeping the exact location of the D-Day invasion a secret, so the German military strategists had to spread out their troops over a larger area, and not all of them even participated in the fight. Additionally, the success of the amphibious invasion created a massive opportunity for the Western Allies to begin to fight eastward toward Germany as it gave them a hold on the mainland where they could deploy more troops without having to make another amphibious invasion. These various factors of the success of the D-Day invasion forced Germany to fight a lossing battle on multiple fronts, greatly weakening their position and ultimately spelling their doom as the end of the war grew near.</p>

      <h2>What if D-Day hadn't happened?</h2>
      <p>Had the D-Day invasion failed, World War Two would have likely still ended with a German defeat for several reasons. By the spring of 1944, Josef Stalin’s Red Army was growing in power and the Germans on the Eastern Front were already in retreat. Sooner or later, the Red Army would have pushed the Germans all of the way back to Berlin and defeated Germany. Additionally, it is likely that Allied forces would continue to make their way up the Italian peninsula and possibly invade Germany through the Balkans. Similarly, the Allies could have bombed the Axis forces to a standstill through a strategic bombing campaign against Germany. While the Allies likely still would have won had the D-Day invasion failed, the USSR would have had much more influence over post-war Europe and communism may have become a highly prominent economic system.</p>

      <h2>Significant Events After D-Day</h2>
      <p>Following D-Day, the Allies rapidly pushed through German defences. Some events showing this decline in the German effort include the Liberation of France, the crossing of the Rhine, and the Battle of the Bulge. The quick liberation of France displays how little effort was put into keeping the Allies out of Western Europe. The Battle of the Bulge, which lasted only a month, was Germany’s last effort to keep the Allies back from Germany, but all of their effort wasn’t enough to stop the Allies. The crossing of the Rhine allowed the Allies into the heart of the Axis powers, signaling that the war was at its end.</p>

      <h2>Hitler's Death</h2>
      <p>Hitler died on April 30, 1945. After one of the most important allied victories in WWII, D-Day, the allies continued to obtain victory after victory in the war, Hitler knew that the end of Germany’s effort was soon coming to an end as the allies invaded Germany. Hitler retreated to the Führerbunker, a bomb shelter in Berlin, with many of his closest allies, in addition to his family. Here, he dictated his will. After hearing the news that Mussolini had been killed, Hitler prepared for his suicide by destroying personal papers and other things, and later committed suicide by shooting himself, leading to the German surrender just a week later and the eventual end of WWII as a whole. Many people close to Hitler also committed suicide, including his wife, by taking poison capsules.</p>

      <h2>Analysis: The significance of D-Day</h2>
      <p>D-Day is one of the most important and remembered occurrences in the entirety of WWII. It was an amphibious assault on the beaches of Normandy, France, the largest one in history. As the allies pushed into France, hoping to liberate it from German control, they were able to have immense success, rapidly pushing through German defences and resulting in the liberation of Paris and the eventual surrender of Germany after Hitler’s suicide. But why is D-Day so important to the history of the world and the events of WWII? First of all, this event was a massive defeat for Germany. It was greater than the battle of Staligrad, the defeat in North Africa, or even the Soviet summer offensive of 1944. Second, the United States and the other Allies were able to accomplish their main objective. This was taking the city of Caen. Caen was a strategic location for the Allies because the bulk of the German armour was situated there and it was a strategic junction city for the Allies as well. Finally, Germany was never able to create a sufficient counter attack against the Allied onslaught. They were running out of resources and even as the land assaults bogged down the Allies were still able to rely on their artillery and air support. In all, the D-Day invasion was extremely important to the Allies for many reasons. It eventually led to the German surrender about two months later and finally the Japanese surrender marking the final end of WWII.</p>
