      <h2>German Army Advantages</h2>
      <p>The German army had several advantages in the North African Campaign, including closer airfields and much more reliable intelligence, which allowed them to outperform the Allies in the sky and respond quickly to allied maneuvers, sometimes even before they happened.</p>

      <h2>Most Significant Battles</h2>
      <p>There were many important battles on the Italian peninsula during World War Two. One of these major battles was the Invasion of Sicily which crumbled the Italian morale and provided a base of operations for further maneuvers on the mainland. Another was the Battle of Salerno, during which the Allies landed on the mainland in a challenging battle against German forces. The Battle for Rome was another significant battle involving four brutal military assaults against German forces to break through the Winter Line and allow for an advance towards Rome. Lastly, the Anzio Landings attempted to cut German communications from Rome via a maneuver behind enemy lines.</p>

      <h2>Roles of African American and Japanese American Soldiers</h2>
      <p>African American and Japanese American soldiers faced discrimination and segregated units despite their bravery throughout the war. Despite often being assigned to more dangerous and difficult tasks, both groups fought valiantly and courageously to show their loyalty to the United States despite racial prejudices, in order to change the public opinion and fight discrimination. African Americans and Japanese Americans repeatedly distinguished themselves as outstanding through their willingness to fight, even though their country did not treat them as equals.</p>
