      <h2>Europe and Germany</h2>
      <p>After the war, Germany was divided between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, forming East and West Germany, and a denazification program led to the removal of ex-Nazis from power and the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. To maintain world peace, the Allies formed the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

      <h2>Tensions between Europe and US</h2>
      <p>After World War Two, Germany was subdivided into four sections, each controlled by one of the four main Allied powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. These nations made up the Allied Control Council. France used its position to obstruct policies that it thought wouldn’t benefit France, and pushed against anything that would lead to a unified German government. Relations with the Soviet Union also deteriorated, and each power ended up running its own administration in their zones. The British and American zones eventually merged into the Bizone, which the Soviets claimed was a violation of the Potsdam Agreement, and walked out of the council, thus incapacitating it. Residents of the Eastern Bloc, controlled by the Soviet Union, fled to West Germany due to a dislike of Soviet control and fear of further restrictions. This prompted East Germany to restrict its borders, eventually resorting to building the Berlin Wall, which grew to symbolize the political divide between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

      <h2>Discovery of the Holocaust</h2>
      <p>At first, images taken at liberated concentration camps were not publicly distributed, so as to avoid alarming people with relatives that were still missing. That changed when American forces found Ohrdruf, where there was a still-blazing bonfire and prisoners executed with bullets to the head. Allied leadership immediately decided that censorship had to be lifted so that the world could see the Nazi atrocities.</p>

      <h2>The Marshall Plan</h2>
      <p>After the war, many European countries were starving, and the Secretary of State George C. Marshal was getting concerned, so he put together a plan that would be funded by the United States to provide relief and rebuild infrastructure. The plan provided capital and materials to Europe, enabling Europeans to rebuild their economy, and creating reliable trading partners. In contrast, the Treaty of Versailles which ended World War One focused on punishing Germany rather than aiding Europe. The Treaty of Versailles is often blamed for worsening the economic hardships of the time and ultimately laying the groundwork for the rise of the Nazi Party.</p>

      <h2>Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</h2>
      <p>On August 6 and 9, 1945, in one of the most controversial US government decisions in history, the United States detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese towns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing between 150,000 and 246,000 people. This is the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict in history. Japan surrendered six days after the bombing, after the Soviet Union’s declaration of war against Japan, and after the invasion of Japanese-controlled Manchuria. This event effectively ended WWII, as the Japanese were the only Axis power that remained in the war.</p>

      <h2>Post-War Relationship of US and Japan</h2>
      <p>After the surrender of Japan, the US began to help bring Japan back into the international community by strengthening their military, political, and economic ties. Eventually, treaties were signed with Japan over time and Japan became an important military ally of the United States. In addition, while the United States occupied Japan, they helped to enact reforms that enabled Japan to recover from the war and become a more democratic society.</p>

      <h2>Analysis: Post-war successes and failures</h2>
      <p>In the European theater of war, the post war was filled with many successes and failures. The rebuilding of Europe’s economy was a stark contrast to the failed treaty of Versailles, as it allowed for all countries to work together in rebuilding their economy rather than laying all of the blame on a single country. However, the post-war divisions of Germany led to the removal of many of the alliances between the US and the USSR, leading eventually to the cold war. In addition, the atrocities at concentration camps were initially kept from the world rather than being exposed to civilians so that they could see the atrocities that had occurred. In the pacific theater of war, the United States handled the rebuilding of their relationship with Japan well, resulting in a successful rebuilding of the Japanese government, economy, and more. This resulted in the United States being in good standing with Japan even through today. In all, the European and Pacific theaters of war both were very important to WWII. In both of them, there were many successes and failures, some of the most notable being the failure of the division of Germany but the success of the Marshall Plan. All of these led to many things, some of which are still present today, including the cold war, the US and Japan relationship, and more.</p>
