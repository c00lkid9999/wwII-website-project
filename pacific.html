        <h3>Attack on Pearl Harbor</h3>
        <p>The attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 was one of the most important battles to the outcome of the war in the Pacific. The Japanese were planning for the attack to deal a massive blow to the United States Pacific Navy, so that the Americans would be forced to agree to a negotiated settlement, but American damages were less severe than the Japanese had hoped, since the American aircraft carriers were away and Honolulu’s submarine base and signals intelligence units went undamaged. The attack sparked outrage across the country, as America was not officially at war, and all opposition to entering the war vanished from the United States. The U.K., Canada, the Netherlands, the U.S., and Australia declared war on Japan within two days.</p>

        <h3>Battle of the Coral Sea</h3>
        <p>On both sides, the Battle of the Coral Sea was presented to the public as a victory. In terms of ships lost, the Japanese sank much more than the U.S., but the United States had won the battle from the strategic standpoint, because the Allies averted the invasion of Port Moresby and lessened the threat to the supply lines between the U.S. and Australia. This was the first time that the Allies had successfully forced a Japanese invasion force to turn back without achieving its objective. This greatly lifted the Allied morale after several defeats during the first six months of war in the Pacific. The battle had a substantial effect on the war, as the retention of Port Moresby made the Allied advance less arduous, and fueled Japanese overconfidence in their ability to carry out carrier operations against the United States. The battle also affected the availability of ships for the Battle of Midway, as Japan was slow to repair their damaged ships, but the U.S. repaired theirs quickly.</p>

        <h3>Battle of Midway</h3>
        <p>The Battle of Midway was possibly the most important battle of the Pacific Theater. It is often called “the turning point of the Pacific,” because it was the first major naval victory against Japan for the Allies. The Battle of Midway allowed the Allies to transition to taking the strategic initiative, and it paved the way for the landings on Guadalcanal. Some authors claim that the heavy losses of carriers and veteran crews weakened the Japanese navy permanently, though this is up for debate. The battle involved the loss of four large fleet carriers plus a large amount of experienced crew, however, which dealt a huge blow to the Japanese carrier fleet. The Japanese and American Navies both tried to accelerate their shipbuilding and aircrew training, but the U.S. was more efficient, so the battle gave them an opportunity to get ahead. The battle also prevented Japan and Germany from meeting up in the Indian subcontinent.</p>

        <h3>Battle of Guadalcanal</h3>
        <p>The Battle of Guadalcanal was one of the first campaigns in the Pacific Ocean Theater of World War II that was prolonged and it strained logistical capabilities on both sides of the war. It prompted the development of combat air transport in the United States for the first time, and forced Japan to rely on reinforcement by barges, destroyers, and submarines, since they could not achieve air supremacy over the Americans. The Guadalcanal campaign was strategically costly to Japan, and caused great losses of material and manpower. This drain of resources directly contributed to the failure of Japan to achieve its objectives in the New Guinea campaign. Japan lost control of the southern Solomons and its ability to intervene in shipping to Australia. The Battle of Guadalcanal was the point when Japanese offensives stopped, and the Allies gained strategic initiative. The battle also proved to be a psychological victory, improving Allied morale and vastly damaging Japanese morale.</p>

        <h3>Battle of Tarawa</h3>
        <p>The Battle of Tarawa was the first time that a U.S. amphibious landing was opposed by well entrenched, determined defenders. The Navy battleships and cruisers were ill equipped to penetrate the Japanese defensive works, and the landing craft had operational shortcomings. In addition, a miscalculation of the height of the coral reefs obstructed the landing. The many failures of the Tarawa landing helped inspire the founding of the Underwater Demolition Teams to help with hydrographic reconnaissance and underwater demolition of obstacles prior to any future landings. The lessons learned in the Battle of Tarawa helped to improve the subsequent landings in the Marshals campaign.</p>

        <h3>Battle of Iwo Jima</h3>
        <p>Iwo Jima was a strategic air base located between the Mariana Islands and Japan. After months of naval and air bombardment, the United States invaded the base on February 19, 1945, hoping for a quick victory. However, the Japanese were able to create a fierce defense, blocking out the invading Marines. About 70,000 Marines and 18,000 Japanese soldiers took part in the battle, which resulted in 7,000 Marines being killed and another 20,000 Marines injured. Only 126 Japanese soldiers were taken as prisoners, all the rest were killed in the battle. The island was officially declared secure on March 26, 1945. This battle is remembered as one of the bloodiest battles in Marine Corps history, and it reduced the morale of Americans hoping for less slaughter in the invasion of Japanese mainlands.</p>

        <h3>Battle of Okinawa</h3>
        <p>The Battle of Okinawa was the last island battle that took place before the anticipated US invasion of the Japanese mainland. The island of Okinawa is a large island that lies southwest of Japan, in the Ryukyus chain. The US wanted to take this island to have a strategic airbase for bombers striking Japan and an advanced naval port. The army and Marine Corps forces invading the island initially faced little resistance, but the Japanese soon put up fierce resistance, with the battle featuring some of the worst kamikaze attacks of the war. The battle went on for three months, and resulted in 49,000 US casualties, 150,000 killed Okinawan civilians, and 110,000 dead Japanese soldiers. This battle was important as it gave the US an important airfield leading to the Japanese surrender in less than three months after the battle.</p>
