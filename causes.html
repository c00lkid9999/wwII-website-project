    <h1>Causes of WWII Research</h1>
    <ul style="font-family: 'Roboto';">
      <li style="background-color: red;">Imposed heavy penalties on the defeated powers after the end of WWI. Most notable is the “War Guilt Clause”, in which the German nation accepted complete responsibility for starting the war. This meant that Germany was held liable for all material damages. The French in particular insisted on imposing enormous reparations. The treaty seemed unfair to the defeated powers, and they quickly violated the terms of the treaty. Ultimately this made far right parties such as the Nazi party more popular with the German public.</li>
      <li style="background-color: orange;">The League of Nations emerged from the Treaty of Versailles with 32 members, including most of the victors of WW1. It eventually expanded to contain Germany and other defeated countries. It was premised on the idea that a threat to one member demanded action from all members. This ultimately failed due to the fact that it required unanimous agreement before taking action, and the offending nation could be the one that vetoed. The League’s “great powers” were unable to respond to the threats and were also uninterested in addressing them, due to trauma and weakness from World War One. The League’s failure to respond only encouraged more invasions and aggression. The U.S. Senate rejected membership, which undermined the authority of the League. The withdrawal of other countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan had the same effect. </li>
      <li style="background-color: yellow;">The rise of fascism in Italy and Germany significantly contributed to the advent of World War Two. Facsism’s main ideas of nationalism, expansionism, and militarism caused fascist powers to invade other countries. It led to the belief that the people of the country were better than the rest of the world’s people. It also allowed the belief that it was morally correct and even necessary for the country to expand. For these reasons, fascist countries such as Italy, Germany, and Hungary began to annex parts of other countries in the late 1930s. This increased global tensions and plunged Europe into war. </li>
      <li style="background-color: lime;">Ultimately the main cause of World War Two was the expansionist ideologies of the Axis powers. These expansionist regimes made use of militaristic propaganda to convince their people that the country had to go to war to gain new territories. This is known as “Lebensraum” (living space) in Nazi Germany. This led to Italy’s conquest of Ethiopia, Japan’s invasion of Chinese Manchuria, and Germany’s annexation of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. These actions kickstarted the war in Europe and Asia. </li>
      <li style="background-color: lightblue;">Appeasement served only to exacerbate the likelihood of war through encouraging Hitler to continue with his expansionist goals. By tolerating territorial aggression from Germany, the United Kingdom and France unwittingly allowed the war to happen. British and French leaders hoped that Germany’s ambitions would settle down peacefully if they agreed to its demands. This backfired, as Germany learned that it could invade more countries with no pushback. Hitler himself reportedly said, “The forty-eight hours after the march into the Rhineland were the most nerve-wracking in my life. If the French had then marched into the Rhineland, we would have had to withdraw with our tails between our legs.” </li>

    <h1>Causes of WWII Essay Outline</h1>
    <ul style="font-family: 'Roboto'; color: white">
      <dl>
        <dt>Intro paragraph:</dt>
        <dd>hook: Talk about the significance of WWII in history.</dd>
        <dd>thesis: Of the many causes of WWII, the most significant were the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations, the rise of fascism, expansionism, and appeasement.</dd>
        <dd>roadmap: This essay will explore each of these causes in detail and analyze their significance to WWII, then conclude with a ranking of their importance.</dd>
        <dt>Paragraph 1: Treaty of Versailles</dt>
        <dd>First of all, the Treaty of Versailles was important to the start of WWII because it imposed heavy penalties on the defeated powers, including Germany.</dd>
        <dd>evidence: The "War Guilt Clause" caused Germany to take full responsibility for starting the war, making the country liable for all material damages.</dd>
        <dd>This shows how Germany was forced into a bad place before WWII, and had to do an unrealistic amount of things for other countries. This led to WWII because Germany held onto animosity toward the other countries, and vice versa, making it more tense for war to break out yet again.</dd>
        <dd>evidence: Second, the aftermath of the Treaty of Versailles made more extreme, far-right parties such as the Nazi Party more popular.</dd>
        <dd>This was due to the Nazi party’s promises of a better future for Germany, no matter what the cost was. This led to WWII as the Nazi party was the party that was in charge of Germany and helped to start WWII.</dd>
        <dt>Paragraph 2: League of Nations</dt>
        <dd>Second, the League of Nations was a cause of WWII because it was full of flaws and weaknesses that the Axis powers were able to exploit.</dd>
        <dd>evidence: The League of Nations was a weak alliance that hung on the premise that the nations needed unanimous agreement.</dd>
        <dd>This shows how if one country, such as Germany, declined, the other countries would have to deal with the veto and were unable to fight back.</dd>
        <dd>evidence: The League of Nations was undermined by the lack of US involvement.</dd>
        <dd>This led to WWII because it made the countries in Europe miss a strong alliance that proved extremely helpful at the end of the war.</dd>
        <dt>Paragraph 3: Rise of fascism</dt>
        <dd>In addition, the rise of fascism contributed to the start of WWII because its core beliefs called for the annexation of other countries, which led to the war.</dd>
        <dd>evidence: Fascism contains the belief that your country is better than all of the other countries in the world.</dd>
        <dd>This led to WWII because it increased Axis animosity towards the Allies, and eventually led to attempted territorial annexation.</dd>
        <dt>Paragraph 4: Expansionism</dt>
        <dd>Next, the expansionist ideologies of Germany and Italy through concepts such as “Lebensraum” accelerated the start of WWII due to Germany, Italy, and Japan’s annexation of many countries.</dd>
        <dd>evidence: Germany's invasion of Poland is generally considered to be the start of WWII</dd>
        <dd>This shows how expansionism directly led to the start of WWII, as Germany’s invasions of other countries caused the Allies to get together and fight back.</dd>
        <dt>Paragraph 5: Appeasement</dt>
        <dd>Finally, appeasement led to the full-scale development of WWII due to encouraging Hitler to continue with his goals.</dd>
        <dd>evidence: Hitler himself said that "The forty-eight hours after the march into the Rhineland were the most nerve-wracking in my life. If the French had then marched into the Rhineland, we would have had to withdraw with our tails between our legs."</dd>
        <dd>This shows how appeasement only encouraged the axis to fight in WWII.</dd>
        <dt>Paragraph 6: Ranking and analysis</dt>
        <dd>Of all of these, the most important is expansionism because Germany’s aggression gave the Allies a reason to team up against it.</dd>
        <dd>Some of the other important ones are the rise of fascism, the Treaty of Versailles, and appeasement.</dd>
        <dd>The least important is the league of nations, as it weakened all of the countries in Europe.</dd>
        <dt>Paragraph 7: Conclusion</dt>
        <dd>In all there were many causes to WWII.</dd>
        <dd>Of all of them, the most important ones were the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations, the rise of fascism, expansionism, and appeasement.</dd>
        <dd>This is important because seeing the causes of WWII can show us how we can prevent something like it from happening again.</dd>
