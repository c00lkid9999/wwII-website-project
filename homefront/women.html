    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Women at work</h1>
    <h3 style="padding: 10px;">American women in WWII played numerous important roles in the war effort. Nearly 350,000 women worked in the US and abroad for the US military, joining the Womenâ€™s Army Auxiliary Corps, the Navy, Coast Guard, and Marines Women's Reserve, the Women Airforce Service Pilots, and the Army and Navy nurse corps. These women were incredibly important and good at their jobs. However, after the war, many women were forced out of their military roles and struggled to obtain veteran benefits.</h3>
