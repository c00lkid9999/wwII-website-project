      <h2>Why was D-Day so significant?</h2>
      <p>D-Day was an amphibious invasion of several beaches in Normandy, France. It was the largest amphibious assault in history, and it began the march eastward to defeat Germany. The invasion’s success dealt a massive blow to German morale, while increasing partisan activity against Germany and increasing Allied Morale. D-Day represents the point in the war where the balance of power in Europe tipped to favor the Allies.</p>

      <h2>Why was D-Day the beginning of the end of WWII?</h2>
      <p>D-Day proved to be a turning point in World War Two because it prevented Hitler from sending troops from France to build up his Eastern Front against the Soviets, and it gave the Allies a hold on the mainland from which to press eastward toward Germany. It forced Germany to fight on multiple fronts and greatly weakened their position.</p>

      <h2>What if D-Day hadn't happened?</h2>
      <p>Had the D-Day invasion failed, World War Two would have likely still ended with a German defeat for several reasons. By the spring of 1944, Josef Stalin’s Red Army was growing in power and the Germans on the Eastern Front were already in retreat. Additionally, it is likely that Allied forces would continue to make their way up the Italian peninsula and possibly invade Germany through the Balkans. Similarly, the Allies could have bombed the Axis forces to a standstill through a strategic bombing campaign against Germany.</p>

      <h2>Significant Events After D-Day</h2>
      <p>Following D-Day, the Allies rapidly pushed through German defences. Some events showing this decline in the German effort include the Liberation of France, the crossing of the Rhine, and the Battle of the Bulge. The quick liberation of France displays how little effort was put into keeping the Allies out of Western Europe. The Battle of the Bulge, which lasted only a month, was Germany’s last effort to keep the Allies back from Germany, but all of their effort wasn’t enough to stop the Allies. The crossing of the Rhine allowed the Allies into the heart of the Axis powers, signaling that the war was at its end.</p>

      <h2>Hitler's Death</h2>
      <p>Hitler died on April 30, 1945. After one of the most important allied victories in WWII, D-Day, the allies continued to obtain victory after victory in the war, Hitler knew that the end of Germany’s effort was soon coming to an end as the allies invaded Germany. In the Führerbunker, a bomb shelter in Berlin, Hitler committed suicide, leading to the German surrender just a week later and the eventual end of WWII as a whole. Many people close to Hitler also committed suicide, including his wife.</p>

      <h2>Analysis: The significance of D-Day</h2>
      <p>D-Day is one of the most important and remembered occurrences in the entirety of WWII. It was an amphibious assault on the beaches of Normandy, France, the largest one in history. As the allies pushed into France, hoping to liberate it from German control, they were able to have immense success, rapidly pushing through German defences and resulting in the liberation of Paris and the eventual surrender of Germany after Hitler’s suicide. But why is D-Day so important to the history of the world and the events of WWII? First of all, this event was a massive defeat for Germany. It was greater than the battle of Staligrad, the defeat in North Africa, or even the Soviet summer offensive of 1944. Second, the United States and the other Allies were able to accomplish their main objective. This was taking the city of Caen. Caen was a strategic location for the Allies because the bulk of the German armour was situated there and it was a strategic junction city for the Allies as well. Finally, Germany was never able to create a sufficient counter attack against the Allied onslaught. They were running out of resources and even as the land assaults bogged down the Allies were still able to rely on their artillery and air support. In all, the D-Day invasion was extremely important to the Allies for many reasons. It eventually led to the German surrender about two months later and finally the Japanese surrender marking the final end of WWII.</p>
