    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Japanese internment</h1>
    <h3 style="padding: 10px;">Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066 established the Japanese internment camps of WWII. Japanese were told to leave, and when some of them did not comply, the United States created the War Relocation Agency to force them to. These Japanese Americans were sent to “assembly centers,” where they did work for low pay, or “relocation centers,” or prison camps. The relocation centers were filled with violence and hatred against the Japanese Americans that had been sent there. In 1946, the last Japanese internment camp was finally closed, and in 1988, Congress issued a formal apology and paid reparations to many Japanese Americans.</h3>
