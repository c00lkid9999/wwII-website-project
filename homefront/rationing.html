    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Rationing</h1>
    <h3 style="padding: 10px;">Rationing was used by the US government in WWII to make sure that soldiers got everything they needed and the reset was distributed fairly. The OPA (Office of Price Administration) was in charge of this task. Their systems were very complex as they rationed off almost everything from sugar and coffee to tires and gasoline. Due to this, the OPA was often used as a scapegoat for the troubles of the war. Despite all this, however, many Americans accepted rationing as a necessary part of the war, regardless of the troubles that came with it.</h3>
